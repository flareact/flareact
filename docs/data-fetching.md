# Data Fetching

Flareact allows you to fetch data for page components. This happens in in your Cloudflare Worker on the edge, using `getEdgeProps`.

By default, **all edge props are cached** for the lifetime of your current deployment revision, but you can change that behavior using the `revalidate` property.

## Fetching Data using `getEdgeProps`

To define props for your component, export an asynchronous `getEdgeProps` function from your React component:

```js
export async function getEdgeProps() {
  const posts = await getBlogPosts();

  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  };
}

export default function Posts({ posts }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map((post) => {
          return <li key={post.id}>...</li>;
        })}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

`getEdgeProps` receives one argument object containing the following properties:

- `params`: Any params corresponding to dynamic routes
- `query`: Any query params e.g. `?foo=bar` sent to the page request, in addition to any `params` generated as part of dynamic routes
- `event`: The `FetchEvent` inside the worker script, including the `request` object (for further parsing) and the `respondWith` method, useful for running tasks out-of-band

You must return an object from `getEdgeProps`:

- It should contain a `props` property containing the props to be passed to your component
- You can optionally pass a `revalidate` argument - see below.
- You can optionally pass a `notFound` argument with a `true` / `false` boolean to return a 404 response - see below.

## Caching and Revalidation

Flareact caches all pages and props at the edge using the [Worker Cache API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/reference/apis/cache/). This benefits you because:

- After the first page view, every single page request will be served statically from the edge, making the response even faster üî•
- You can fetch data from external APIs and headless CMS endpoints without having to worry about scale or load
- One less point of failure, in case an external data API goes down for maintenance, etc.

However, you might want to fetch a fresh set of data from `getEdgeProps` occasionally. This is where the `revalidate` property comes in. Pass a number to `revalidate` to tell Flareact to cache this page for `N` number of seconds:

```js
export async function getEdgeProps() {
  const data = await someExpensiveDataRequest();

  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
    // Revalidate these props once every 60 seconds
    revalidate: 60,
  };
}
```

There might be times when you **never want the page to be cached**. That's possible, too ‚Äî just return `{ revalidate: 0 }` from `getEdgeProps` to tell Flareact to fetch a fresh page every single request.

To recap:

| `revalidate` value | Cache Behavior                                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| (none)             | Cache until next deploy                            |
| `0`                | Never cache                                        |
| `1` (or greater)   | Cache that number of seconds, and then revalidate. |

**Note**: In development, props are requested each page load, and no caching is performed.

## 404 Response

A 404 response can be returned if required for SEO purposes. For example if you could not find the requested data in KV or another data source.

The current implementation only does this on hard page loads. Client-side routing between different pages using the `link` component still returns a 200. However the `notFound` parameter will be present in both cases for you to display an appropriate message to the user.

```js
export async function getEdgeProps() {
  const posts = await getBlogPosts();

  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
    // If notFound true is returned, display message to user
    notFound: true,
  };
}

export default function Posts({ posts, notFound }) {
  return (
    <>
    { notFound === true &&
      <div>
        Sorry, we could not find your posts!
      </div>
    }
    { notFound === false &&
      <div>
        <h1>Posts</h1>
        <ul>
          {posts.map((post) => {
            return <li key={post.id}>...</li>;
          })}
        </ul>
      </div>
    }
    </>
  );
}
```

## Redirects

Dynamic redirects can be returned if required, for example to prevent an unauthenticated user from accessing a secure page.

```js
export async function getEdgeProps() {
  const signedIn = await isSignedIn();

  if (!signedIn) {
    return {
      redirect: {
        destination: "/",
        permanent: false
      }
    };
  }

  return {
    props: {}
  }
}
```

The redirect object should contain two parameters:

- `destination` is the location you want to route to. This can either be a path or a full url.
- `permanent` if the redirect is permanent or not.

Redirects will work on both hard and soft loads. URL parameters can be used in the destination provided they are part of the original request url.

```js
export async function getEdgeProps() {
  return {
    redirect: {
      destination: "/news/[slug]",
      permanent: true
    }
  };
}
```

Note that if redirects for a page are defined in both the edge props and the custom webpack config then the latter will be given priority.

## Additional Notes

A couple things to note about `getEdgeProps`:

- The code you write will **always run on the edge** in a Worker context. This means it will _never_ run client-side in the browser.
- You can use `fetch` natively within `getEdgeProps` without needing to require any polyfills, because it is a first-class WebWorker API supported by Workers.
- Code and imports included and used exclusively for `getEdgeProps` will be removed automatically from your client-side builds. This means you can import heavy worker-side libraries without having to worry about impacting your client runtime performance üòç
- In a worker context, **you DO NOT have access to the filesystem**. This means anything that references the Node.js `fs` module will throw errors.
- You can only define `getEdgeProps` for page components living in your `/pages` directory - not for any other components living elsewhere.
- Transitioning from Next.js? `getStaticProps` is aliased to `getEdgeProps`, so you don't need to make any changes!
